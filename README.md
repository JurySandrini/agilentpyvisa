# agilentpyvisa
A WIP library to control B1500 and similar testers via the VISA protocol, built on pyvisa

# Introduction
As I need it for my research internship, I will develop a python based library to make writing complex tests as convenient as possible. I am putting it on Github so others can use it if it helps them as well, critique it and maybe give me some advice on how to do things
 
It is very much a work in progress and not stable at all. It is also missing a lot of functions and was not tested yet.

# Design Goals

When I write one off scripts, I like the code to be self documenting. The bulk of the work so far has been creating Enums and namedtuples to make sure there are no magic numbers or cryptic commands, at the expense of more typing. But that is what ipython tabcompletion is for.

# Documentation and examples
will come soonish
